# The-Sync-fire-deSync-Model

Deciphering episodic content from cortical alpha oscillations.

This code will run the simulations used for the Sync-fire deSync model paper submission. 
Simply run the file, run_all.m, specifying a directory to store data in, i.e. run_all(filename);
This code is parallelised, but will still take some days to run and process (depending on number of cores in CPU). Full data set (very large) available on request. 

If you want to change parameters, see set_parameters.m.
